From an imported spreadsheet (xlsx) this module allows to transform data
in Polars dataframe and process in order to achieve powerful operations
on data directly on columns.

A such dataframe can help to prepare data in order to be used to
create/update or import.

If you want apply them a common process to automate things whatever
source, polars can help you.

Why dataframe ?

-  a dataframe is a kind of in-memory dataset on which you can operate
-  you can operates on your entire dataset a bit like with a database
   but in memory: you don't need to iterate on each line to perform
   operations
-  the operations are powerful: filter, add column resulting from
   calculation, select a subset of data.

Why Polars ?

-  performance: code in rust
-  environment consideration
-  dynamic project

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
